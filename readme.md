# Revolut Java/Scala Test

[![N|Solid](https://dl.myket.ir/newresizing/resize/medium/png/icon/com.revolut.revolut.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

Design and implement a RESTful API (including data model and the backing implementation) for money
transfers between accounts.

**Explicit requirements:**
- keep it simple and to the point (e.g. no need to implement any authentication, assume the APi is
invoked by another internal system/service)
- use whatever frameworks/libraries you like (except Spring, sorry!) but don't forget about the
requirement #1
- the datastore should run in-memory for the sake of this test
- the final result should be executable as a standalone program (should not require a pre-installed
container/server)
- demonstrate with tests that the API works as expected

**Implicit requirements:**
- the code produced by you is expected to be of high quality.
- there are no detailed requirements, use common sense.
